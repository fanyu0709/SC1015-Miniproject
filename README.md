# SC1015 Miniproject: B137_team 5

## 01 Motivation/Rationale

We believe that this dataset as well as question is relevant to our society today as many of us may be looking to attain a high economic well being to escape the rising cost of living. However, our quest for a high economic wellbeing may have potentially caused elevated stress levels and deteriorating mental health, resulting in the increasing suicide rates. NTU also has a university wellbeing office to take care of students' mental wellbeing. Hence, as NTU students who will be entering the workforce in a short few years, we are concerned about this issue.

Hence, we found the dataset: **Suicide_Rates_Overview** which compiles data on countries' economic wellbeing and their suicide rates. From this, we hope to acheive a better understanding on whether our quest for a high economic wellbeing will affect the suicide rates.
