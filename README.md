## 01: Motivation/Rationale

We believe that this dataset as well as question is relevant to our society today as many of us may be looking to attain a high economic well being to escape the rising cost of living. However, our quest for a high economic wellbeing may have potentially caused elevated stress levels and deteriorating mental health, resulting in the increasing suicide rates. NTU also has a university wellbeing office to take care of students' mental wellbeing. Hence, as NTU students who will be entering the workforce in a short few years, we are concerned about this issue.

Hence, we found the dataset: **Suicide_Rates_Overview** which compiles data on countries' economic wellbeing and their suicide rates. From this, we hope to acheive a better understanding on whether our quest for a high economic wellbeing will affect the suicide rates.

Question: 
**How does a country's economic well being affect suicide rates among different demographic categories?

## 02: Data Preperation and Cleaning

## 03: Exploratory Data Analysis

## 04: Use of machine learning techniques to solve specific problem

## 05: Data driven insights & recommendations

### Project Outcome
There is a very weak correlation between a country's economic wellbeing and its suicide rate. However, since a relationship exists, a country's economic wellbeing can be considered a contributor towards suicide rate. For that, it answer our question on how economic wellbeing of the country affect the suicide rates across different demographic categories.

### Something interesting
Through this project, we also found out something interesting, for the 5 countries that we used to determine the relationship between the two variables, we observed that the distribution of suicide/100k pop varies greatly across countries. This means there are other factors that are likely to be intangible that contribute to this difference.

### Based on Machine Learning results
Based on the results provided by our machine learning techniques on our data, we found that generally, men are more likely to die by suicide than women. This may be due in part to the fact that men are more likely to work in industries that are vulnerable to economic downturns, such as construction and manufacturing. Therefore, policies that aim to support men's mental health and reduce the stigma associated with seeking help can be effective in reducing suicide rates.
